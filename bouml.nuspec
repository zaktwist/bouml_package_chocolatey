This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

			BOUML is a free UML 2 tool box including a modeler allowing you to specify and generate code in C++, Java, Idl, Php, Python and MySQL.
		</summary>
		<description>
			BOUML is a UML tool box allowing you to specify and generate code in C++, Java, Php, Python, MySQL and IDL.
			
			The main key points of BOUML are :
			
			 - it is again a free software since the release 7.0
			
			 - it runs under Linux, MacOS X and Windows
			
			 - it allows to program simultaneously in C++, Java, Php, Python and IDL
			
			 - thank to a full access to the generated forms, you are the master and you decide what must be generated
			
			 - it is extensible, and the external tools (I name them plug-out because they are executed outside BOUML) may be developed in C++ or Java, using BOUML for their definition as any other program (clearly I do not like very much language like Visual Basic, and I do not understand how this one can be imposed in a UML environment !)
			
			 - it is fast and doesn't need a lot of memory to manage several thousands of classes, see benchmark
			
			The initial reasons inciting me to develop BOUML was mainly : the pleasure to develop freely a tool and I hope to see it used by many people (I already had this very pleasant experience with two friends for Xcoral), and frankly a reaction to the very expensive price of the commercial UML tools.
			
			Due to license violations, attacks and insults from people of wikipedia (the worst of them were the administrators Bapti, Dereckson and Esby), I have decided to stop the free version of Bouml (the release 4.23 was the last free version of the first sequence), and to move to the non free version starting by the 5.0, upto the 6.12
			
			Finaly end of May 2017 I decided to distribute again BOUML as a free software
			
			The implementation of BOUML since the 5.0 is based on Qt version 4, while the previous versions of BOUML was based on Qt 3 / 2.4.
			
			The documentation is written with OpenOffice.org writer, many thanks for this powerful and pleasant office suite. The screen copies are made with Ksnapshot and sometimes modified by Le Gimp to have burred areas, thanks to the authors for these practical tools.
			
			Some of the examples given in this documentation spoke about the organs, describing an organ is very easy for me in French ... not in English ! I get the English translation of the words associated to the organs from a Marya J. Fancey documentation, thanks to her.
			
			
			
			License
			Since the release 7.0 bouml/bouml.exe are free of use.
			
			The releases of bouml/bouml.exe from the 5.0 up to the 6.12 was not free, to use them you needed to buy a license, and to run them on a host at a date autorized by this license. I don't manage any more these versions.
			
			The code generators/reverse/roundtrip more projectControl and projectSynchro are free of use.
			
			The other plug-outs are free; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any later version.
			
			The code generated for the plug-outs is under the term of the GNU General Public License because it contains the API sources. In the other cases the code generated by BOUML is usable without any restriction (i.e. no license).
			
			Copying and distribution of the documentation or a part of the documentation and screenshots is permitted in any medium, provided a mention of Bouml or https://www.bouml.fr
			
			The versions of bouml and associated tools older prior the 5.0 are free; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any later version. I don't manage any more these versions.
